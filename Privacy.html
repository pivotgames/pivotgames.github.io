      </ul>
      <h5 class="wp-block-heading">4.2. In-game advertising (i.e. when you view ads in Our Games)</h5>
      <p>To enable us to show in-game ads, we may send your advertising ID and IP-address to advertisers (or ad
        networks) to enable them to find appropriate ads to serve to you in our games and on third-party
        properties. You can control and limit our use of your advertising ID in your device settings. We do not
        control which specific ads are shown in our games (it is controlled by ad networks), but we do blacklist
        certain categories of ads.</p>
      <p>Advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes (please refer to the Privacy Notices
        of our advertising partners listed here) including:</p>
      <p>limit the number of times you see the same ad;</p>
      <p>ensure they are dealing with humans with real devices and not ‘automated’ bots;</p>
      <p>serve you with advertisements likely to be relevant to you based on your advertising ID engagement with
        other brands and ads, also recorded using your advertising ID and using your general geographic area.
        Other brands buy advertisement placement via an ad network or ad exchange to advertise their products in
        Our Games. The ad network or ad exchange acts as an intermediary between the other game companies and Us.
        In order for an ad network to charge the company buying the ad, clicks from the ad and potentially
        installs of other developers’ applications party apps are tracked. Views, clicks, and installs from ads
        are measured using Advertiser ID;</p>
      <p>keep track of what games you have used to market you similar kinds of games. IP-address is typically used
        by advertisers to broadly see the general geographic area you are coming from for example country, state,
        and sometimes at the city level).</p>
      <h5 class="wp-block-heading">4.3. View of Our ads on third-party services</h5>
      <p>We also advertise Games in other apps by asking ad networks to serve them to audiences that will be
        interested in them (determined using Advertising IDs).</p>
      <p>The Advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes (please refer to the Privacy
        Notices of our advertising partners listed here) including: measuring ad effectiveness (looking at
        aggregated views, clicks and installs they generate through their advertising in other publishers’ games);
        informing players, that have not been playing for a while, about new content in the Game. We give a list
        of these users in the form of Advertising IDs to an ad network. Ad network then shows these users ads
        about the new content; not showing ads on a game that a player is already playing. We can send a list of
        active players in the form of Advertising IDs to an ad network. Ad network then excludes these players
        from seeing the ad; marketing games to a group of potential players.</p>
      <h5 class="wp-block-heading">4.4. WHO CAN SHOW PERSONALIZED ADS TO YOU?</h5>
      <p>Please see the list of advertising providers that are allowed to show personalized advertising and review
        their data processing practices, including the technologies they use for the purposes of personalized
